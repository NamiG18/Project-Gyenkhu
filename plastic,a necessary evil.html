<h2>Plastic, A Necessary Evil.... Or, is it?</h2>
<br>In this fast paced, technologically advanced society where there are new things being invented everyday, the
one thing that has remained the same over the years is the use of plastics. All of us are well aware about its
negative implications. It has been stated and re-stated several times through almost every means of communication.
By looking at its advantages, why would anyone want to stop using plastics? Since the 1960s, the use of plastics
 increased globally. Factories started packaging their products in plastic as it was and still is, a very cheap
 alternative of transporting and preserving the products produced. Keeping factories aside, plastic is used in
 every aspect of our lives. The straws through which we drink, are made of plastic. The bags we use to carry
  our purchases from the market, are made of plastic.
 Even parts of our very essential mobile phones are made of plastic. Plastics have become indispensable. Plastic
 has infiltrated every nook and corner of our lives. Without plastics, we would have to resort to other
 alternatives that aren’t nearly  as convenient as using plastics are.
But this very plastic has destroyed our environment.<br>
<br>The big question now is what can we do? How do we restrict the usage of this ‘essential’ item? What can we do
to save the environment? What can we do right? The biggest problem with plastics is the act of recycling. Over
 300 million tones of plastic is produced each year and only 9% of it is being recycled! The rest of it is
 irresponsibly dumped in the oceans, harming the entire ecosystem.  The simplest way we can solve this problem is
 if we act now. Start from home, from yourself. <em>Segregate your waste responsibly and recycle what you can.
   <b>It may be a small start but with the help of each one of you, the impact I assure you will be big.</b></em><br>
